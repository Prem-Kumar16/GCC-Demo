TITLE : Find Roots of quadratic equation.

DESCRIPTION : 
	This is a C Program to find the roots of quadratic equation.

	Nature of roots of quadratic equation can be known from the quadrant = b2−4ac.

	-> If b2−4ac >0 then roots are real and unequal.
	-> If b2−4ac =0 then roots are real and equal.
	-> If b2−4ac <0 then roots are imaginary.
